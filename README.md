Hello,
Thank you for this fun challenge.
The design was made on Figma.
You can find basic information about the application below.


## What did i use?


- Expo (45.0)
- TypeScript
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
- [moment](https://momentjs.com/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Redux Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist)
- [Async Storage](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage)


## Try it!

clone project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/furkanuzundev/aklimda.git
```

install the packages

```bash
yarn install
```

start the package server

```bash

When you start the expo server, you can scan QR code from your phone or ```press i``` for iOS or ```press a``` for Android to run project the devices on the same network.

Then enjoy ü•≥
